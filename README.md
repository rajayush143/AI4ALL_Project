Our project:

1) Cropped large satellite images to 300 by 300 images
2) Extracted three types of features: RGB histograms, HSL histograms, and edge magnitude histograms
3) Ran five models on the given dataset: Logistic Regression, SVM, RF, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree
    - Since Random Forest did the best, we decided to implement RF on the satellite images
4) Used our RF model to create predictions
    - Then, we stitched the images back together and tinted each safe zone with green and each unsafe zone with red
  
Our final image predictions are in the repository along with the final code and helper functions.
